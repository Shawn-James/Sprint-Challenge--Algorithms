#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)
> The loop range is n³, but n² within each loop. The difference is n.


b) O(n log n)
> Outer loop is n, inner loop is log n because the pointer is doubled each loop.

c) O(n)
> Uses recursion but each call only has one recursive call. Like a single for loop.
